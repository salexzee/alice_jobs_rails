Alice Jobs
==========

Alice Jobs is a job search website made specifically for Alice Springs, Australia. My goal with this is to help improve the job market by providing a single place to find out who is hiring, while providing an avenue to quickly be able to fill out job applications online. And if a job doesn't have online applications, you can be pointed in the right direction as to where you can fill out a paper application.

This project is still in Development, but you can visit it at http://alicejobs.com.
